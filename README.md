This repository downloads and cleans GAEZ version 3, available at http://gaez.fao.org/Main.html

The website uses Flash. I cannot work on Python to download the data via Flash. So follow these steps to download.

1. Log on to [GAEZ Portal](http://gaez.fao.org/Main.html).

2. Create your account by clicking Register on top right.

3. Log in by clicking Login on top right.

4. Search the data via the Theme pane on the left column.

5. Once the desired data shows up on the main pane, double-click it.

6. For documentation, click Metadata on top right and then in the pop-up window click Download PDF on the bottom right. Save the downloaded PDF file in the /docs folder.

7. For data, click the zip icon in the Download Options box on top right. Unzip the downloaded file, which creates a new folder. This folder contains several files. Move the TIFF file to the /orig folder. This is the one we work on. For the rest, they may be needed for presentation purposes. So move the whole folder to the /docs folder.
